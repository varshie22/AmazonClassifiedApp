Project Development Steps
1. Flow Mapping
2. OOPS - > Identification of Objects and Attributes
            User - id, name, phone, email, password, address, createOn, type, status.
            1 - admin
            2 - user

            Classified - id, headline, productName, productBrand, condition, description,category,price, Images, userID, adminID, status,

            	1 - available
            	2 - sold
            	3 - pending (pending for approval) - this would be used to see all the classified request made by the user using status as pending it means it needs the approval

            Transaction - id,type, classifiedID, UserID, amount, createdOn
            	Type
            	1 - UPI

            User to classified   – 1 to many
            User to transaction – 1 to many
            Classified to transaction – 1 to 1

4. Code of the Project
             4.1 Modules
             eg : Admin
                  User
                  etc...
             4.2 Well Packaging
             4.3 Design Pattern
             Singleton to Design DataBase Structure
             Factory for RTP Behaviour
5. Test Cases
              Microsoft Excel and Junit
6. Build the Project
